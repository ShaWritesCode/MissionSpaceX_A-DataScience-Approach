Data Collection:

* Gathered data from public APIs and datasets related to SpaceX launches.
* Performed initial data preprocessing and cleaning.

Data Wrangling:

* Structured and transformed raw data for analysis.
* Dealt with missing values, data types, and inconsistencies.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

* Conducted visual and statistical analyses to uncover trends.
* Utilized SQL for in-depth querying of structured data.

Interactive Visualizations:

* Created dynamic visualizations using Folium and Plotly.
* Developed an interactive dashboard for real-time data exploration.

Machine Learning Prediction:

* Built classification models to predict launch success probabilities.
* Evaluated model performance and provided actionable recommendations.
